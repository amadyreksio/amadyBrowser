# amadyBrowser
A web browser made in electron

To build it, you'll need node.js.
Once you install it, you just have to enter the directory of the unzipped files, then in terminal:
**run:**
- npm i
- npm start
The app should start.

Make sure, when you edit my code, add a little text file named 'original_author.txt' with this text inside:
"Original project 'amadyBrowser' was made by amadyreksio."
